# WebScraper
This is a simple .NET console application published on a Windows Server 2012. It is a simple web scraper that sends a message on a Discord Server with the details from a specified website.
The GenericWebScraper.cs class contains a method that lets the user request data from a specific XPath from the desired URL. 
In this particular case I requested the price and the product name from different stores then I get a message on my Discord Server.
I run the application on the Windows Server and I used the Thread.Sleep() method to get a message on Discord once/day.
